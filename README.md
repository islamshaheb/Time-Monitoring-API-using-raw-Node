For installing NodeJs in your local machine Just go [this Website ](https://nodejs.org/en/download/ "NodeJS") and download and install it..

After installation, you need to download this full repo on your local machine.
No additional setup is required. 

I used raw node js for building this project. No additional packages or libraries or frameworks are used here.

Users have to log inÂ for using this system. I generate a token when a user log in. They have to use a token while logging in. The expiration time of that token is 30 minutes, means In 30 minutes user do not need to give their information if they want to log in again.

Users can create,read, update and delete their data(CRUD operation). 

Now. write `npm start` and hit enter. Done. Code Has been executed. Server is running...
